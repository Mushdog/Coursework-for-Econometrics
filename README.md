 Conduct Causal Inference Using Some Parametric Econometric Models with R Codes.
## Assignment 1
We conduct causal inference under unconfoundedness by using the cross-sectional data lalonde included in the R package Matching. 

1.1 Estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) by the OLS estimation. For the specification of the linear regression model, see the following example code.

1.2 Estimate the ATE by the inverse probability weighting (IPW). First, estimate the propensity score by using the parametric maximum likelihood method for the logit model. Then, estimate the ATE.

1.3 Estimate the ATE by the propensity score matching estimation. 

1.4 Implement the nonparametric bootstrap

## Assignment 2
We use the ivmte package for understanding the marginal treatment effect (MTE) analysis developed by Mogstad, Santos, and Torgovitsky (2018). 

## Assignment 3
Understand the difference-in-differences (DID) analysis with multiple time periods.
